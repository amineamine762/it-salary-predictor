#  IT Salary Predictor (Machine Learning from Scratch)

A Machine Learning project that predicts IT engineer salaries using **Linear Regression implemented from scratch** with **Batch Gradient Descent**.

This project does not use scikit-learn — the full learning algorithm (cost function, gradient computation, and gradient descent) is manually implemented using NumPy.

---

##  Project Overview

The model predicts salary based on the following features:

- Experience  
- Years in Company  
- Certifications  
- Projects Completed  

The goal of this project is to deeply understand:

- Linear Regression  
- Cost Function (MSE)  
- Gradient Computation  
- Batch Gradient Descent  
- Model convergence visualization

```

## How It Works

### 1️⃣ Model Implementation (`model.py`)

- `predict()` → Computes predictions  
- `compute_cost()` → Mean Squared Error cost function  
- `compute_gradient()` → Computes gradients  
- `gradient_descent()` → Optimizes parameters  

### 2️⃣ Training Script (`train.py`)

- Loads dataset  
- Initializes weights and bias  
- Runs Gradient Descent  
- Prints predictions  
- Saves cost convergence plot (`cost_plot.png`)  

---

##  Cost Function

The model minimizes the Mean Squared Error:

J(w,b) = (1 / 2m) * Σ (f(x) - y)^2

---

##  How to Run

### 1️⃣ Create virtual environment

```bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

```

### 2 Install Dependencies

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3 Run Training

```bash

python train.py

```

After training, the script will output predictions, final optimized weights and bias, and save the cost convergence plot as `cost_plot.png`.
